This is a Chrome extension to block undesired requests.

Installation
---
* [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/request-blocker/cblonkdlnemhdeefhmaoiijjaedcphbf)

Features
---
* Block requests by methods and URL patterns
* Maintainable lists
* Easy to share your lists with others

What makes it different?
---
There are blockers such as ABP, blocking requests by URLs.

Request blocker can do even more, blocking requests by both methods and
URLs. For example, sometimes we need to show data via GET requests, but
don't want to make modifications via POST requests, so we just block
the POST ones and keep the GET ones.
